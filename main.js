ðŸ‘‰ Title: Defeat the enemy!
ðŸ‘‰ Description: Your simple adventure game is off to a flying start, but now you need to add a combat system.
// Your function will take three inputs - firstly the player's attack agility, secondly their attack, and finally the enemy's health.
// First, give the player an agility check. The idea is that the player's agility will be a number between 1 and 10.
// If the player's agility is greater than 5, they will be able to attack the enemy. If it's higher than ten, nothing will happen, because they overpowered themselves - they're too agile!
// If the player's agility check is successful, subtract the player's attack from the enemy's health. Both the player's attack and the enemy's health can be anything you like.
// Make it so that the enemy's health is 0 or less, the enemy is defeated.

// We want a very specific output from this function, so feel free to copy the below:

- If the player's agility check is successful and they make a non-lethal hit, return (`You hit the enemy! Their health is now ${enemyHealth}!`)
- If they make a lethal hit, return (`You hit the enemy! They are defeated!`)
- If the player's agility check is unsuccessful, return (`You missed!`)
- If the player's agility check is overpowered, return (`Not this time - you overpowered yourself!`)

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function attack(playerAgility, playerAttack, enemyHealth) {
  // Write your code here!
